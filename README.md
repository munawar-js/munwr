## Summary

I'm a self-taught Frontend engineer. I have built websites and products for B2B and B2C companies. In the past, I have worked with Freshworks and been part of Freshdesk, Freshchat, and Freshcaller.

My core strength is creating a details-oriented proof of concept from scratch. I am good at breaking product requirements into smaller and actionable tasks.

I ensure my code is at par with industry best practices, so any developer can pick my work without needing me to guide them. I have a keen interest in web development, website & web app performance, UI/UX design, software engineering best practices, and saas products.

I take pride in delivering pixel-perfect websites & web apps that work irrespective of screen size, platform, browser, and device without compromising usability and accessibility.

I also contribute to open-source projects and share free Jamstack and mobile templates.
